# Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning Model (Gaussian Naive Bayes ) with 99.55% Accuracy
This repository provides a Crop Recommendation System using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 99.55%. The system uses agricultural and environmental data, including soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, to recommend the most suitable crop for farming. Key features of this project include:

- Implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes for multi-class classification.
- Data preprocessing with label encoding and train-test splitting.
- Detailed evaluation using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics.
- Visualization of model performance.
- Real-time predictions for crop recommendations based on input parameters.
- Model persistence using Python's pickle library for reuse.
- This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to precision agriculture, aiding in improving crop yield and optimizing farming practices.
